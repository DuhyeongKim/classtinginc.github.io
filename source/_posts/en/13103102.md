“The world has often looked at Korea’s achievements in education<!-- more --> with such envy that if it there was to be a way to export great teaching, Korean classrooms would probably rival smartphones. Actually, there is a way to export it. While many parents and teachers shudder at the sight of students using their smartphones, a Korean start-up called “Classting” saw an opportunity to forge new connections between teachers, students and parents. Teachers and students across the world are using the app and the company has got a 1 billion won investment from Softbank Ventures.”

-By Eric Schmidt (Google CEO)
